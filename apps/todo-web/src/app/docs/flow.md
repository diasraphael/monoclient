### write down small set of user stories

- As a user I need to create a template(Daily/Monthly/yearly/quaterly)
- As a user, I should be able to add tasks under a template.
- As a user, I should be able to view templates and their tasks.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete a template.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete a task.
- As a user, I should be able to mark a task as completed.

### Identify entities + attributes

1. User

user_id (PK)

name

email

password_hash (if authentication needed)

created_at

2. Template

template_id (PK)

user_id (FK â†’ User)

title (e.g., Daily, Monthly, Custom name)

type (enum: daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)

description

created_at

updated_at

3. Task

task_id (PK)

template_id (FK â†’ Template)

title

description

status (enum: pending, in-progress, completed)

priority (optional: low, medium, high)

created_at

updated_at

### Define relationships

users (1) â†’ (N) templates

templates (1) â†’ (N) tasks

tasks (1) â†’ (N) user_entries

### What is password_hash?

Itâ€™s not the actual password.

When a user sets a password, systems donâ€™t store it in plain text (unsafe).

Instead, the password is run through a hashing algorithm (like bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2) which produces a hashed value.

That hash is what gets stored in the database.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

Password: MySecret123

Stored in DB as: $2a$12$w8XGbz5d1... (random-looking string)

When the user logs in, their input is hashed again and compared to the stored hash. If they match â†’ correct password.

ðŸ”’ Why do we have it?

Security: If the database leaks, hackers canâ€™t directly see passwords.

Authentication: It allows us to verify the identity of a user safely.
